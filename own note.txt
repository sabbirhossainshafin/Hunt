1 rem=16px
pyo vs pxo (know the difference)
if property is not working then use !important
if same properties are two position then it must be use the after property and that would be absolute(content,bottom and left or right must be included)
custom js: if there is included centerMode then must be included padding:0. padding must be include for the solution.
